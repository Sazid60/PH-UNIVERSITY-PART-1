In this module,

We start by learning about the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and how to initiate a project. We analyze the requirements for a university management system and model the necessary data. We'll design a database schema and create Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams to organize data. Then, we'll set up API endpoints, build user interfaces, and implement data validation. The course also covers refining code for user validation, routes, controllers, and services. We'll create student user accounts, fix bugs, and set up a global error handler. Additionally, we develop a "not found" route and a response utility, and we wrap up by creating an index route and summarizing the modules. This ensures you gain practical skills for building web applications.

## 11-1 What is SDLC, How we should start a project

- This Project will be based on MVP

#### What is SDLC?

- The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a systematic process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying software applications. It provides a structured framework that helps software developers and organizations deliver high-quality software that meets customer expectations while adhering to time and cost constraints.

#### PLANNING->ANALYZE->DESIGN->IMPLEMENTATION->TESTING & INTEGRATION->MAINTENANCE

- Analyze : Product Owner, Project Manager, Business Analyst
- Design: System Architect, UI/UX Designer
- Development: Frontend, Backend , Fullstack Developer
- Testing : Solution Architect, QA Engineer, Tester
- Deployment : Database Administration, DevOPS
- Maintenance : Support Engineer, Tester, Developer

#### Requirements Steps

- Analyze : Product Requirements Document(PRD), Business Requirements Document(BDR), Software Requirement Specification(SRS), Functional Requirement Document(FRD)
- Design: System Design Of Software, High Level Design Document, Low Level Design Document, Database Schema
- Development: Frontend, Backend , API Integration, Database Schema
- Testing : Test Plan, Test Case, Test Scripts, Defects Report
- Deployment : Release Notes, Installation Guide, Configuration Guide
- Maintenance : Change Request, Bug Report, Patch Release

#### How we will work ?

- Requirement Analysis -> ER Diagram ->API Endpoint -> WireFrame

### 11-4 Design Schema and ER Diagram

- SQL Table is called Collection In NoSQL
- SQL Row is called Document In NoSQL
- SQL Column is called Field In NoSQL

#### We can Do Embedding Or Referencing In NoSQL.

- We can do embedding Up to max 16MB since a document can be only 16 mb
- In Referencing There is no Limitation

##### So where there i a chance of growing data we should use referencing

##### Embedding Pros and cons

| **Pros**                            | **Cons**                    |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Faster Reading                      | Slow Writing                |
| Update all data with a single query | Update query can be complex |
| Less expensive lookup               | Limited size                |
|                                     | Data duplicacy              |

##### Referencing Pros and cons

| **Pros**        | **Cons**              |
| --------------- | --------------------- |
| Faster Writing  | Slow Reading          |
| Avoid Duplicacy | Slow Expensive Lookup |
| Scalability     |                       |
